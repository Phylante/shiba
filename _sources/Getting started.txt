Getting started with Shiba
==========================

Installing
----------
You can get Shiba from PyPi python packet manager or directly from the GitHub repository:

- From **PyPi**:

  ``$ sudo pip install shiba``
 
- Download the .tgz from the GitHub repository, extract, and run:

  ``$ setup.py install``

- From Git:

  ``$ git clone git://github.com/shibaAPI/shiba.git && cd shiba && python setup.py install``

How does this works?
--------------------
First, import the main *Shiba* module, and create an instance of the *shibaconnection.ShibaConnection* class with your login, token pasword [1]_ and domain if you
want to work on the sanboxed version of the *PriceMinister WebServices*.

Then all you have to do is importing the management module you wish to work with, giving it your instanced connection class, and start dealing with those WebServices
through its methods.

I want an example!

This example will show you how to get new sales information on your seller account::

	from Shiba.shibaconnection import ShibaConnection
	from Shiba.salesmanagement import SalesManagement

	init = ShibaConnection("mysellerlogin", "mytokenpwd")
	salestool = SalesManagement(init)
	newsales = salestool.get_new_sales()

Now you can scroll the `lxml.objectify` object returned by the method::

	 purchaseid = newsales.response.sales.sale[0].purchaseid # Getting the first sale on the list, retrieving the purchase ID
	 purchasedate = newsales.response.sales.sale[0].purchasedate # Retrieving the purchase date

And here we go! All you have to do is to implement those methods to your needs.

Testing
----------
Shiba comes with its tests, run ``nosetests`` with a proper login and password (Nosetests configuration file in ``Tests/Assets`` as ``nosetests.cfg``).
